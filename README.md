This package adds support for resolving packages hosted on OpenUPM as package dependencies.  Inspired by [mob-sakai's](https://github.com/mob-sakai) [Git Dependency Resolver For Unity](https://github.com/mob-sakai/GitDependencyResolverForUnity).

## Usage

### Package User
1. Install [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html) if you have not already
2. Install this package (see [ü™õ Installation](https://github.com/nmacadam/com.nmacadam.openupm-dependency-resolver/blob/main/README.md#-installation))

### Package Developer

```JSON
{
  ...
  "openUpmDependencies": {
    "your.package": "1.0.0",
    ...
  }
}
```

- You must use `openUpmDependencies` instead of `dependencies` to define OpenUPM-based dependencies for the package.
- Package users must install `com.nmacadam.openupm-dependency-resolver`.
- Optionally specify a which package version to retrieve from OpenUPM
  - You may use the version string `default` to download the latest version (though this is not recommended)

## ü™õ Installation
Install [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html) if you have not already.
